The overall website version has shifted to V2 from V1 as it can now be navigated and has a overall theme. 
Week 3 TODO's have been shifted to week 4, as they were the long term objectives and week 3 incorporated a lot more html and css than originally intended in order to strongly familiarize myself with the basic elements before implementation of the interactive elements.

Version 
3.5.1
Date.js: file created to make getting time its own file
css.css: updated to include table 
TrackingLifts.html: Added a table and input options as well as a drop down options menu. Added script function to update table with input values. Imported time from Date.js to have it updated at all times.
athelete.tsx : added memberInfo class to store data
readStore.js: Supposed to read through the table as input is added and store the data as a .json on the localStorage, however appears to need adjustment.
Week 4 Todo was completed 

updated final

TODO:  
For next checkpoint:  
Figure out how to add textbox that can be submitted to the website and stored.  
Figure out how to link the time or date to the submission and store that data alongside with it.  

Week 3:
Add different exercises and a scroll bar to choose exercise that is linked with the textbox mentioned before. Will use typescript for the scroll bar, react for the interacion, and html for the data to store exercise types
